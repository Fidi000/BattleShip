servername = "localhost"
username = "battleshipproject";
password = "ContWdeOTzAb3Seh";
data base name = "accountinfo"

Install XAMPP, once installed run the apache and mysql functionalities, under actions. Then press admin in the MYSQL row to open the php admin page.

In the MySQL admin, create a new user with a username and password mentioned above [MUST USE THIS USERNAME AND PASSWORD] AND WITH THE DATA BASE NAME ABOVE, and import the players.sql found in the main folder, which should give you all the 
information in the data base that you need.

However, there is a script to populate with more random data found in the test_function folder, open the name.html page in a server environment,
and press the button and more names should be added.

Once that is done all the other pages will work when hosting on the server in the intended way and you will be able to play.
